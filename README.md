Spam Detector D:
Remove Your Dirty Spam
Spam Detector will detect your spam!

Features
Import a training folder to train the Spam Detector
Import a testing folder to test out the Spam Detector Program
Find the accuarcy and precision of each dataset (E-Mail)
Spam Detector is a program that uses datasets of E-Mails to train the program to recognize whether or not new E-Mails are spam. The basis of this training and testing model is using Naive Bayes spam filtering and Bag-of-words model techniques.

Improvements
Using more E-Mail datasets containing spam can improve the machine learning process of the program. This will imrpove the precision and accuracy of the model.

Steps to clone application
Contained in one folder using the ==trainFile== program
Have a training dataset of ham and spam in the same directory as ==trainFile==
This will create a probability output map that will be used for testing
Training
javac TrainingFile.java
java tranFile <train/ham> <train/spam>
Testing
javac TestingFile.java
java testFile <PrSW_i.txt> <test/ham> <test/spam>
Test a new dataset of E-Mails spam and ham using our training model before, that is the probability map
Run JavaFX and boom
